# Jabberwocky-Sentence-Generator
Jabberwocky Sentence Generator for Ukrainian and Turkish

In this project, we have come up with jabberwocky sentence generator using a probability matrix for both languages depending on the existing words in the languages. Using these probabilities, the code generates pseudowords, and assigns them into different syntactic categories. It also adds suffixes compatible with the rules of the languages and creates jabberwocky sentences. 

In order to get the sentences, you can run the all cell block in order in both languages' notebooks.
